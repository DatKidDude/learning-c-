The following function is supposed to insert a new node into its proper place in an ordered list, returning a pointer to the first node in the modified list. Unfortunately, the function doesn't work correctly in all cases. Explain what's wrong with it and show how to fix it. Assume that the node structure is the one defined in Section 17.5.

    ```C
    struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
    {
        struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;
        while (cur->value <= new_node->value) {
            prev = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        prev->next = new_node;
        new_node->next = cur;
        return list;
    }
    ```

Solution: The function works when inserting nodes in the middle of the list but does not work when inserting nodes at the beginning or end of the list.

    ```C
    struct node *insert_into_ordered_list(struct node *list, struct node *new_node)
    {
        struct node *cur = list, *prev = NULL;

        // Handling last node case
        while (cur != NULL && cur->value <= new_node->value)
        {
            prev = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
        }

        if (prev == NULL) {
            list = new_node;
        } else {
            prev->next = new_node;
        }

        new_node->next = cur;
        return list;
    }
    ```
