Write the following function:

    ```C
    int count_occurences(struct node *list, int n);
    ```

The list parameter points to a linked list: the function should return the number of times that n appears in this list. Assume that the node structure is the one defined in Section 17.5

    ```C
    int count_occurrences(struct node *list, int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (list) {
            if (list->value == n) {
                count++;
            }
            list = list->next;
        }
        return count;
    }

    ```
